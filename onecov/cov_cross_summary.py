class CovCROSSsummary(CovCOSEBI,CovBandPowers):
    """
    This class calculates the covariance of the same tracer using two different
    summary statistics. It also calculates their respective cross-covariance.
    It inherits all the functionality of the other summary statistics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cov_dict : dictionary
        Specifies which terms of the covariance (Gaussian, non-Gaussian,
        super-sample covariance) should be calculated. To be passed from
        the read_input method of the Input class.
    obs_dict : dictionary
        with the following keys (To be passed from the read_input method
        of the Input class.)
        'observables' : dictionary
            Specifies which observables (cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy
            lensing and/or clustering) should be calculated. Also,
            indicates whether cross-terms are evaluated.
        'ELLspace' : dictionary
            Specifies the exact details of the projection to ell space.
            The projection from wavefactor k to angular scale ell is
            done first, followed by the projection to real space in this
            class
        'THETAspace' : dictionary
            Specifies the exact details of the projection to real space,
            e.g., theta_min/max and the number of theta bins to be
            calculated.
        'bandpowers' : dictionary
            Specifies the exact details for the bandpower covariance.
    cosmo_dict : dictionary
        Specifies all cosmological parameters. To be passed from the
        read_input method of the Input class.
    bias_dict : dictionary
        Specifies all the information about the bias model. To be passed
        from the read_input method of the Input class.
    iA_dict: dictionary
        Specifies all the information about the intrinsic alignment model.
        To be passed from the read_input method in the Input class.
    hod_dict : dictionary
        Specifies all the information about the halo occupation
        distribution used. This defines the shot noise level of the
        covariance and includes the mass bin definition of the different
        galaxy populations. To be passed from the read_input method of
        the Input class.
    survey_params_dict : dictionary
        Specifies all the information unique to a specific survey.
        Relevant values are the effective number density of galaxies for
        all tomographic bins as well as the ellipticity dispersion for
        galaxy shapes. To be passed from the read_input method of the
        Input class.
    prec : dictionary
        with the following keys (To be passed from the read_input method
        of the Input class.)

            Look-up table for the clustering redshifts and their number
            of tomographic bins. Relevant for clustering and galaxy-
            galaxy lensing estimators.
        'zlens' : dictionary
            Look-up table for the lensing redshifts and their number of
